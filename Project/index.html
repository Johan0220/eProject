                    <p class="content-p">The earliest recorded systems of weights and measures
                        originate in the 3rd or 4th millennium BC. Even the very
                        earliest civilizations needed measurement for purposes of
                        agriculture, construction and trade. Early standard units
                        might only have applied to a single community or small
                        region, with every area developing its own standards for
                        lengths, areas, volumes and masses. Often such systems
                        were closely tied to one field of use, so that volume
                        measures used, for example, for dry grains were unrelated
                        to those for liquids, with neither bearing any particular
                        relationship to units of length used for measuring cloth or
                        land.
                        <span class="read-more-text"> With development of manufacturing technologies, and
                            the growing importance of trade between communities and
                            ultimately across the Earth, standardized weights and
                            measures became critical. Starting in the 18th century,
                            modernized, simplified and uniform systems of weights and
                            measures were developed, with the fundamental units
                            defined by ever more precise methods in the science
                            of metrology. The discovery and application
                            of electricity was one factor motivating the development of
                            standardized internationally applicable units. For most quantities a unit is necessary to
                            communicate values of that physical quantity. For
                            example, conveying to someone a particular
                            length without using some sort of unit is impossible,
                            because a length cannot be described without a
                            reference used to make sense of the value given.
                            But not all quantities require a unit of their own.
                            Using physical laws, units of quantities can be
                            expressed as combinations of units of other
                            quantities. Thus only a small set of units is required.
                            These units are taken as the base units and the
                            other units are derived units. Thus base units are the
                            units of the quantities which are independent of
                            other quantities and they are the units of length,
                            mass, time, electric current, temperature, luminous
                            intensity and the amount of substance. Derived
                            units are the units of the quantities which are
                            derived from the base quantities and some of the
                            derived units are the units of speed, work,
                            acceleration, energy, pressure etc.
                            Different systems of units are based on different
                            choices of a set of related units including
                            fundamental and derived units.</span>
