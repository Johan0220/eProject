                <h2 class="title-h2">HISTORY OF MEASUREMENT</h2>
                <p class="content-p">The earliest recorded systems of weights and measures
                    originate in the 3rd or 4th millennium BC. Even the very
                    earliest civilizations needed measurement for purposes of
                    agriculture, construction and trade. Early standard units
                    might only have applied to a single community or small
                    region, with every area developing its own standards for
                    lengths, areas, volumes and masses. Often such systems
                    were closely tied to one field of use, so that volume
                    measures used, for example, for dry grains were unrelated
                    to those for liquids, with neither bearing any particular
                    relationship to units of length used for measuring cloth or
                    land. With development of manufacturing technologies, and
                    the growing importance of trade between communities and
                    ultimately across the Earth, standardized weights and
                    measures became critical. Starting in the 18th century,
                    modernized, simplified and uniform systems of weights and
                    measures were developed, with the fundamental units
                    defined by ever more precise methods in the science
                    of metrology. The discovery and application
                    of electricity was one factor motivating the development of
                    standardized internationally applicable units. For most quantities a unit is necessary to
                    communicate values of that physical quantity. For
                    example, conveying to someone a particular
                    length without using some sort of unit is impossible,
                    because a length cannot be described without a
                    reference used to make sense of the value given.
                    But not all quantities require a unit of their own.
                    Using physical laws, units of quantities can be
                    expressed as combinations of units of other
                    quantities. Thus only a small set of units is required.
                    These units are taken as the base units and the
                    other units are derived units. Thus base units are the
                    units of the quantities which are independent of
                    other quantities and they are the units of length,
                    mass, time, electric current, temperature, luminous
                    intensity and the amount of substance. Derived
                    units are the units of the quantities which are
                    derived from the base quantities and some of the
                    derived units are the units of speed, work,
                    acceleration, energy, pressure etc.
                    Different systems of units are based on different
                    choices of a set of related units including
                    fundamental and derived units.</p>
